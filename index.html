        What's up people it's Gibbo. I'm currently studying coding at 
        the University of Birmingham and am loving everything so far! (even Javascript at times)
        My main interests are listening (sometimes creating) podcasts, being a dad and playing
        semi-competitive MTG.
        Here you can find all of my wonderful and unique creations.

        ManaStack is a Magic: The Gathering deck organiser that I made since I could not find anything like
        it online so, I decided to make my own. It comes with the Scryfall API to find any card you like and 
        each new set is updated into the client within 3 days of release. Build your next deck!

        <p> 
          This application allows the user to search for any card ever created in the history
          of MTG. There is also an 'Advanced Search' setting which allos the user to be specific 
          on what type, cost and format legal cards they might be searching for. Find that right card for your deck!

          Calculating the correct mana base for decks can be tough, which is why I created 
          'MTG on Curve'. After entering your deck, the application will Calculate for you the percentage
          chance you will be playing your spells on curve. Upgrade your manabase!
