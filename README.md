# Challenge 2: Professional Portfolio

## Creating my portfolio

As I have now created some applications, it was time to create my own portfolio to exhibit my work 
to others.

### User Story

AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

### Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## Issues identified and corrected

Main issues I came across was making sure my containers included all the content I wanted.
At times, the text, images and titles were out of shape so I had to reconfigure their CSS attributes
Making sure to anchor within the document with the nav bar and also linking externally my applications 
was tough but also worked in the end.

## Future work

- Use of Javascript
- root to change entire selectors if necessary

I have added into HTML alt: notes and into CSS also /*notes*/ to help any future edits by making it easier to see what the different elements are in the code and if any collaboration work will be done in the future.
